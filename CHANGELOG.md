  - **release.yml:** Add emojis to workflow name and step names for better readability This commit adds emojis to the workflow name and step names to make them more readable and visually appealing. The workflow name now includes a rocket and a megaphone emoji to represent the release and publish actions respectively. The step names now include emojis that represent their respective actions, such as a bell for checkout, a gear for setup, a package for build, a pushpin for pushing tags, and a globe for publishing to registries.

### ü©π Fixes

  - **release.yml:** Change npm ci to npm i to fix issue with installing dependencies The `npm ci` command was causing issues with installing dependencies, so it was changed to `npm i` to fix the issue. ([1dc6380](https://github.com/nyxblabs/materialiconic-product-icons/commit/1dc6380))
  - **release.yml:** Add --no-dependencies flag to vsce package command The --no-dependencies flag is added to the vsce package command to prevent the inclusion of unnecessary dependencies in the package.

  - **package.json:** Replace nyxlx with npx in changelog, preversion and version scripts The nyxlx command was replaced with npx to ensure that the changelogen package is executed from the latest version.
